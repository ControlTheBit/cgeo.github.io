# Development

c:geo is an open source application, distributed under [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Source Code

Our source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo).

If you would like to participate in the development you will find all relevant information in our [Readme](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/blob/master/README.md) and our [Wiki](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/wiki) on GitHub.

## Developer chat

If you would like to contact the developers directly you can join our IRC channel [#cgeo on freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23cgeo). Be aware that it might take some time until someone can respond to your question, most activity happens in the evening (European time zones).

## Our website

Like our application also this website is open source and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo.github.io).

If you find errors or outdated information on it or you have ideas for improving it, you are welcome to contribute as described in the [readme file](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo.github.io/blob/master/README.md).

We are also looking for people willing to help writing a users manual for c:geo. Just contact us via GitHub if you are interested.

## Nightly Builds

If you want to test new features of upcoming versions, you can use our nightly builds. These are current development snapshots, which you have to install manually on your device.

Nightly builds are not for normal usage, as they contain code that is not well tested yet. You should only install these versions if you know what you're doing.

If you install a nightly build to your device, you may experience crashes or missing functionality. Please report such bugs, but don't expect us to deliver a fix right afterwards. If you need stable functionality, use the normal build please.

The version without JIT is necessary for some devices with a MediaTek CPU. If you observe strange behavior in the live map or jumping distances, try this build.
