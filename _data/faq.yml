      - title: I am new to Geocaching. How does all of this work?
        content: |
            Explaining all details of Geocaching would be a little to much here. However there are some facts you need to know to start Geocaching with c:geo:

            1. You need an account on a geocaching platform to use it in c:geo:

                We are supporting [geocaching.com](http://www.geocaching.com/), which is an international caching platform, and Opencaching platforms in several countries (e.g. [opencaching.de](http://www.opencaching.de/), [opencaching.pl](http://www.opencaching.pl/)).

                Choose the platform you would like to use, go to the website and create an account (basic accounts are usually free of charge).

                After you retrieved a username and password for one of the platforms, enter them in c:geo settings to allow c:geo to login to the server.

            2. You have to learn about the different cache types, D/T-ratings, etc.

                You might not be successful finding a cache by just selecting a random one in c:geo and navigating to it. There is a lot more which you need to know in order to pick a cache which is suitable for you.

                Most of the mentioned platforms offer detailed tutorials about how Geocaching works. We strongly suggest, that you read through these tutorials to learn what you need to know to find your first cache and how to log it.

                Especially you should be aware of the different types of caches (You will typically not find a mystery cache at the given coordinates) and the T-rating (a rating of 5 means, that you need to climb/swim/dive to get the cache).

            3. Find a cache near you and try it:

                Use the "Live Map" or the "Nearby" function of c:geo to see which caches are around you. Pick a cache (a traditional cache with a low D/T rating will be a good starting point) which you would like to find and go for it!

            Once again: You should make yourself familiar with the different types, terrain ratings, attributes, etc. before starting out to find a cache.

      - title: How to login?
        content: |
            When you start c:geo the first time it will directly take you to the service settings where you can enter your username and password for the desired caching platforms.

            To access the service menu manually from the c:geo main screen please select: \\
            Menu - Settings - Services

            After you entered your username and password there, all you have to do is pressing the back key on your device until you reach the c:geo main menu. On the next start c:geo will automatically take you there.

            When you are at the main menu, most functions should be self explanatory. Otherwise you might also find some hints in this FAQ.

      - title: I see caches in c:geo, but how to get them?
        content: |
            If you managed to see caches on the map or in the nearby list, select a cache and open its details.

            Read the listing text and pay attention to the D/T-ratings and attributes to learn more about how to log this cache.

            If you are good to go, press the "Navigate" icon (Pointing arrow) in the title bar.

            You will have several options depending on your needs. Here is a brief description of the most important navigation methods:

            - Compass:

                It will constantly show you distance and direction to the cache.

            - Radar ([optional](http://lineflyer.github.io/faq.html#faq.HowcanIuse)):

                If you installed an app supporting radar functions this will open a radar screen.
                It is similar to the compass, but the working mode is a little different. You will typically see the cache coordinates as a marker on the radar. If the marker reaches the center, you reached the cache coordinates.

            - Navigation (Drive, Walk, Cycle):

                This will start turn-by-turn navigation using Google Maps

            When you reach the coordinates, remember that GPS has an accuracy of several meters/feet only (also depending on your phones GPS performance). So you should look around your position as well to find the cache.

      - title: I forgot my username and/or password!
        content: |
            c:geo is only using the login details you specified on the geocaching website.

            You have to go to the geocaching website to reset your password. After you successfully restored your password there, please go to c:geo settings and enter the new login data.

            For example on [geocaching.com](http://www.geocaching.com/) you can reset your password on [this page](https://www.geocaching.com/login/password.aspx).

      - title: Login failed is shown on the main screen!
        content: |
            First of all please check carefully whether you entered the correct username and password.
            You can find this in: \\
            Menu - Settings - Services
            Afterwards select "Check Login" (for geocaching.com users only) to see if login is either now possible or what error is returned.

            If you have doublechecked your credentials and still get an error message (e.g. Login failed, Unknown Error) the following might be helpful:

            Sometimes network providers insert messages into the HTML-traffic which prevents c:geo from logging in while on mobile network.
            A clear indication for this problem is, that c:geo only works on your WiFi connection at home but not while on a mobile network.
            In this case please go to the c:geo settings Menu - Settings - Services and enable "Identify as Android Browser".
            Afterwards you might have to restart your phone to be sure these settings take effect.

            There have been reports, that in rare cases the login still fails although the login data is OK and also "Identify as Android browser" did not help.
            In this case we recommend resetting c:geo to factory defaults as described [here - LINK TBC](#):

            If the problem still persists, please contact our support and provide a system log.

      - title: How to reset c:geo to factory defaults?
        content: |
            Attention: \\
            This procedure will delete all stored caches and app settings!

            1. If needed, perform a backup of your caches in Menu - Settings - System - Backup
            2. Go to your Android settings (not c:geo settings) and select Apps or Appmanager - c:geo - "Delete data"
            3. On the next start of c:geo it will be back to factory settings and take you directly to the login screen.
            4. Enter your login data for the desired geocaching website
            5. Restore your backup (You will be asked for restoring once you enter the main screen of c:geo)

- title: General
  items:
      - title: How can I change to miles instead of meters?
        content: |
            c:geo uses metric units by default but should detect automatically if your phones default is set to imperial units.

            You can also manually select your preference in c:geo settings: \\
            Menu button - Settings - Appearance - "Use Imperial units"

      - title: Why do the cache details miss new information?
        content: |
            In order to minimize the network traffic c:geo downloads caches only once and stores them temporary or permanently (if you save them on your list).

            So if you miss some information (e.g. newest logs are missing, description has changed,etc.) please refresh the stored cache by selecting "Refresh" on the cache detail page.

      - title: Why are all cache coords wrong by some meters/feet?
        content: |
            In case you are not logged in the geocaching website does not provide correct coordinates. So it seems you did not provide login data or the login data you provided is not correct.

            Please refer to [Getting started](./faq.html#faq.IamnewtoGe) to learn how to login with c:geo.

      - title: Why does c:geo not use Groundspeak's public API?
        content: |
            The initial idea of c:geo is to provide a free (and open-source) app for mobile geocaching for everybody. \\
            What would change with the API?

            - c:geo only for premium members
            - No support for OpenCaching or other platforms than geocaching.com
            - Groundspeak advertisements

            There are also problems with the development:

            - The API requires a private key for the app. But c:geo is open-source. There are a lot of independent developers, but only one would get the key. All other developers wouldn't be able to test what they do.
            - c:geo would no longer be open source
            - Only a few core developers would be allowed
            - Much slower development would result from that

            While Groundspeak's API would fix most of our current problems, c:geo would then force users to pay money to a corporation. This is not the opensource spirit.
            If Groundspeak says OK to our ideas then c:geo might have an API some day...

      - title: The website is always shown to English!
        content: |
            c:geo is accessing the geocaching website as a customized internet browser. \\
            In order to retrieve the information from the website it needs to have reliable information. Therefore c:geo will change the language to english when logging in, because iz can not support all different languages.

            Feel free to change the language on the website back to your desired language anytime when using it. c:geo will detect this and automatically swuitch back to english on the next login.

      - title: Unkown Location is shown on the main screen!
        content: |
            The address information shown at the bottom of the main screen is an information we receive from a geocoding database based on your position. Sometimes this database has no address information for your location or the service is not running. In this case 'Unknown Location' or even a wrong city could be shown.

            This does not have any impact on the c:geo functionality. As long as you have a GPS fix everything will work normal. \\
            If you want you can also disable the address information in c:geo settings so your coordinates are shown on the main screen instead of the address information: \\
            Menu - Settings - Appearance - "Show Address"

      - title: What coordinate formats are supported in c:geo?
        content: |
            c:geo supports geocoordinate notations in the following formats:

            1. Degrees and decimal minutes (MinDec)

                Notation: DDD° MM.MMM'
                Example: N 51° 20.382 E 007° 01.820

            2. Degrees, decimal minutes and seconds (DMS)

                Notation: DDD° MM' SS.SSS"
                Example: N 51° 20' 22.920" E 007° 01' 49.200"

            3. Only degrees (DegDec)

                Notation: DDD.DDDDD°
                Example: 51.339700° 7.030333°

            Format 1 is commonly used for Geocaching and thus also the default notation used in c:geo.

            You can change to the other formats by short tap on coordinates shown for caches and waypoints.
            When entering coordinates in c:geo (e.g. creating a waypoint) you can select the desired format in the headline of the dialog according to the notations listed above.

            The conversion from and to UTM notation is currently not supported by c:geo. In case you need to convert coordinates to UTM you can copy the cache coordinates by long tap on them to perform conversion in another app.

      - title: What is the storage path for log pictures taken with c:geo?
        content: |
            If you select to take a new picture it will be saved to a directory which follows a system default. \\
            On most devices it can be found in a directory "/sdcard/Picures/cgeo".

      - title: Is it possible to edit an existing geocache log with c:geo?
        content: |
            No, this is not possible and we do not have plans to implement this on short term.
            Please use the geocaching website to edit your log after you posted it.

      - title: c:geo data is always stored in internal memory!
        content: |
            There are two things we are storing on your device:

            1. The geocache database containing basically the content of your lists

                The database is stored in an internal folder on your device (not accessible without root access). Typically this database will only have a size of some megabyte.
                For the database you can choose in the c:geo settings whether it is stored internally or on the SD-card.

            2. The additional data (e.g. images, maps) for all the caches stored in the database

                This additional data can be much larger as it contains the images of the cache description and (optionally) the images retrieved from logs and (optionally) static maps.
                The additional data is stored on SD-card by default (in a folder called ".cgeo").

            Some users are complaining, that the additional data as well as the database (if external storage is selected) are still stored in the internal memory of their devices.
            We always place the folder on the storage medium that the device tells us is the sdcard. And in fact, technically this is on some devices only a part of the internal memory which is mounted as a SD-card (It's like a SD-card fixed mounted in your device).

            Unfortunately there is no standardized method to find the location of a real SD-card on your device. There are some workarounds but those might fail on some devices, thus we decided not to implement them for now.
            Furthermore starting with Android 4.4 write access to the real SD-card is forbidden for apps.

      - title: Can I login using my Facebook account?
        content: |
            No, the login via Facebook is an option on the geocaching website only.
            In order to login to geocaching.com via c:geo you need to enter the username and password dedicated to the website.

            In case you currently only use Facebook to login to geocaching.com, you have to go to the [Password Reset Page](https://www.geocaching.com/login/password.aspx) to set up a regular password first.
            After you got this password you can use it together with your username to log in with c:geo.

      - title: Can c:geo post to Facebook?
        content: |
            No, currently c:geo does only support Twitter as a social network.
            As the development team has limited ressources and is focussing on new geocaching features we currently do not have plans to implement a Facebook connection.

            However if you are Twitter user already and/or you are looking for a way to post your findings to Facebook, please note that there is a possibility to link Twitter to Facebook.
            Doing so all your tweets will also be posted on Facebook (including the c:geo tweets).

            You can find more info on the [Twitter support website](https://support.twitter.com/articles/31113-using-twitter-with-facebook/).

      - title: Submitting a log with picture takes a long time!
        content: |
            As current smartphones can produce high res pictures with a size of several MB the upload of those can take some minutes (depending on the connection speed) if you do not select to scale them.

            Please consider using the c:geo scaling function to scale down the resolution before submitting the log.

      - title: The compass shows wrong directions or stops moving!
        content: |
            In 99% of these cases the problem is your device. 
            c:geo only uses the position and compass information provided by the Android system.

            Please first of all try to calibrate the compass sensors of your device. On most devices this can be done by turning the devices around all of its axis three times or moving it horizontally in shape of the number 8 until the compass shows the right magnetic direction.
            Please be aware that electric field (such as high voltage lines near to you) might influence the device sensors.

            If the problem is still not solved you should try another app with compass functionality (e.g. [GPS Status & Toolbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2)) to verify your device capabilities.
            If another app has the same problems you can be sure, that the problem is on your device.

            If nothing helps and the problem persists, please contact us and provide detailed information about your device and the compass misbehaviour.

      - title: Is c:geo available for iOS or WindowsPhone?
        content: |
            No, c:geo is written for Android and has more than 50 000 lines of code. We will not port it to iOS or other non android systems because it is too much work. Furthermore the iOS AppStore / Apple is very restrictive and most of us don't like it.

            But c:geo is open source! That means that everyone can get the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo) and rewrite it for other operating systems. Feel free to port (and maintain) it, but please keep the open source license in mind.

      - title: Does c:geo work on Blackberry devices?
        content: |
            Although there is no native c:geo app for Blackberry OS you can still run c:geo on it.
            The current version of Blackberry OS supports sideloading of Android applications. 

            Just download the Android APK file [here](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/releases/latest) and install it to your Blackberry phone. Instructions about sideloading Android applications can be found in the internet.
            But please be aware, that we can not give a guarantee that all features are working and can't provide support in case of problems.

      - title: Translations are missing or wrong!
        content: |
            We are using a crowd sourced translation platform to improve the translation and even include new languages.
            If you see untranslated (i.e. English) or wrong strings or your language is not even supported, you are invited to contribute on this platform!
            
            Just create a free account on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) and start contributing translations or vote for existing proposals to the [c:geo Crowdin Project](https://crowdin.com/project/cgeo).

      - title: Logs made with c:geo are truncated on the website!
        content: |
            Especially on [geocaching.com](http://www.geocaching.com/) it may happen that log texts are interpreted as HTML code although they are not written in HTML. \\
            If you e.g. include a "<" or ">" sign in your log, it may appear truncated or bad formatted later. This does not only affect c:geo but also if you write this kind of log direclty on the website.
            Reason for this is a bad implementation for HTML detection on the website, but no fault in c:geo.

            You need either to avoid such special characters in your log or use HTML-formatted logs to work around this problem.

      - title: Scanning for GPX files takes a long time!
        content: |
            c:geo scans the whole SD card if it cannot find gpx files in the predefined folder.
            If you have a lot of files and folders on your SD-card this scanning might take some time.

            It is useful to put all of your PQs into a specific folder and set this as the default import directory for gpx imports. This folder will be scanned first which will speed up the process. 

            You can specify the GPX import and export folders in the settings of c:geo: \\
            Menu - Settings - System - "GPX Export Directory" / "GPX Import Directory"

      - title: I am not able to install c:geo from PlayStore!
        content: |
            There are some reasons why installing c:geo from the [PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cgeo.geocaching) might not be possible.
            
            1. c:geo is shown as "Not supported" for your device:

                This means that either your device is running on an Android version below 2.1 or it does not support GPS.

                Android versions below 2.1 are no longer supported by c:geo. 

                If you are on a Android version above 2.1 but your device has no GPS and you still want to install c:geo on it, you have to install c:geo manually by downloading the APK file [here](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/releases/latest).
                But be aware, that you can not navigate to caches without GPS!

            2. You can not find c:geo on the Playstore:

                That is probably a wrong setting in your [PlayStore settings](https://play.google.com/settings). 
                It has a content filtering with a rating that has four different levels, where "All" is the level which can be shown to all users. 
                c:geo however is not on that level, because Google requires apps with position tracking to be level "Low".
  
                To be able to install the app, you must either choose "Low" (pre teen) or set the option "Install all apps" (which looks exactly like the "All" level, but has a completely different meaning).

      - title: How to send a log to the developers?
        content: |
            If the app is not working as it should you can send a log to the developers.

            When c:geo crashes or does not work properly it writes debug messages to an android log if this option is set in c:geo settings.
            This log contains data of all apps for a short period of time (from several seconds to several minutes).
            Collecting a log as fast as possible after the crash is essential for us.

            Please note that your device needs to have an Android version below 4.1 to get a proper system log.
            On higher Android versions Google disabled the logging ability for security reasons except your device is rooted.

            Please find a detailed description of how to get a log in our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/wiki/Send-log-to-developers).

      - title: I want to install an older version of c:geo!
        content: |
            Generally we do not recommend to install an outdated version of c:geo, because it might no longer work as expected as newer versions often include adaptions to changed functions of the geocaching platforms.
            So we strongly recommend not to go back but to apply all updates as soon as they are available.

            We can not guarantee that older versions will still work!

            If you however still want to install an old version (e.g. for testing purposes) you can find a version history with download option in our [Guthub Release History](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/releases/).
            Please be aware that you need to uninstall a newer version of c:geo on your device before installing an older version as downgrading is not possible.

      - title: I don't use Google Play but still want to use c:geo!
        content: |
            You can download the newest version of c:geo directly to your device from [here](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/releases/latest/).

      - title: Can I hide a cache and publish it using c:geo?
        content: |
            Publishing a new cache with c:geo is not possible and there are no plans to implement this function.
            However you can still use c:geo to record waypoints to help you planning your cache hide. 
            To do so simply use the 'All destination' function which offers a history of the coordinates you entered.

            There are also other apps available on [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/) helping you to record and average coordinates for your new cache (e.g. [GPS Averaging](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.destil.gpsaveraging) or [Geocache Placer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.rocologo.geocacheplacer)).

            In order to e.g. beta-test an unpublished cache you will not be able to access the cache online (because it is unpublished) but you can import the cache via GPX or add the cache waypoints manually to another cache already stored on your device.
            Furthermore you can view your own unpublished caches with c:geo by searching for its geocode online.

      - title: How to setup my device to get the best possible location?
        content: |
            Android has different meachnisms to provide location information to apps:

            1. Network based location information derived from Wifi signals and mobile networks
            2. GPS position information derived from the device GPS receiver

            You should make sure to enable both of these sources to get the best possible location information in c:geo in every situation.
            This can usually be done in your device settings (not in c:geo itself) in a menu called "Locations" or similar.
            Please select all possible sources in that menu or (in newer Android versions) select the "High accuracy mode".

            Furthermore you should check if your device supports "Google Play Services" and eventually enable the usage of that in c:geo: \\
            Menu - Settings - System - "Use Google Play Services"

      - title: I am not able to post a log online!
        content: |
            If you select the menu icon to send your log and you get a message saying "Loading Log-Page" the log page on the server was not yet loaded.
            Check if you have an internet connection and wait a moment until the required data has been loaded and then try again to send your log.

            In case you can not establish an internet connection or the geocaching server is down you can also select to just save the log on your device and send it later by reaccessing the log page.
            To do this just press back on your device, the log will automatically be saved.

            You can also batch submit offline stored logs as fieldnotes to the geocaching website at a later point of time.

      - title: How can I hide PM only caches?
        content: |
            On geocaching.com some caches are accessible for Premium Members only. If you are a Basic Member you will still see them in your search results and on the live map but can't open them.
            Sadly it is not possible to hide them by default due to server limitations.

            The only possibility is to hide them in your lists and search results by applying a local filter in c:geo: \\
            Menu - Filter - Status - "All member access"

      - title: I can't see PM only caches although I am Premium Member!
        content: |
            While logging in to the geocaching.com website c:geo will automatically detect whether you are basic or premium member, but c:geo will only perform a login if it is necessary.
            So after you became a premium member it can happen, that c:geo does not know this yet.

            In this case you can force c:geo to login by either selecting Menu - Settings - Services - geocaching.com - Check Login or simply rebooting your phone and starting c:geo again.

      - title: What is the meaning of the icons on the right side of cache lists?
        content: |
            If you look at a list of caches (a search result or caches saved on your device) the right side contains some symbols, colors and numbers.
            Here is a brief explanation of their meaning:

            Color in the lower half:

            The color represents the average [GCVote](http://www.gcvote.com) rating for this cache, where green means good (>3,5 stars),brown means average (between 2,5 and 3,5) and red means a rather bad rating (<2,5 stars).
            If there is no color shown the cache does not have any votes yet or is not supported in GCVote (GCVote does curerntly only support geocaching.com caches).

            Number in the lower half:

            The number in this field represents the amount of favorite points of geocaching.com or referals for opencaching.x given to that cache by users.

            Symbol with number in the upper half:

            The symbol is a marker which is only shown if the cache contains trackables.
            The number right next to it is the amount of trackables listed in this cache.

      - title: c:geo suddenly stopped working!
        content: |
            There can be several reasons that c:geo is not working as it should.
            You should do the following steps:

            First of all please check if you are using the latest version (check on [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cgeo.geocaching) for updates or load the latest version directly from [here](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/releases/latest)). If a new version is available you should also see an update notification on the c:geo main screen.
            If you are using an outdated version please update, because there might be changes on the geocaching website which need a new version of c:geo to work.

            Please check if your device is connected to the internet and also try other connections (e.g. Wifi instead of mobile network or vice versa).
            If c:geo works on another connection there seems to be a problem with your network.

            Go to c:geo settings (Menu - Settings - Services) and check your login. 
            If it fails please make sure you are using the correct login credentials. Those are the same you use for the geocaching website.

            Check if there are any notifications about problems shown on the c:geo main screen and check our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/android.geocaching) to see if others also have a problem and/or we reported a known problem there.

            If your problem is still not solved, please contact us and provide a detailed description of your problem and what you tried already to solve it. We will answer as soon as possible.

      - title: The nearby search also returns caches far away!
        content: |
            Besides geocaching.com c:geo is also supporting opencaching platforms for several countries.
            If you activate the opencaching service in the c:geo settings the nearby search will also provide you the nearest opencaching caches.

            if you however accidentally activate an opencaching platform of a foreign country (e.g. you are living in Germany and have activated "opencaching.org.uk") you will see caches some hundred kilometers away in the nearby list as those are the nearest caches on this platform.
            In this case please deactivate the unneeded opencaching platforms in: \\
            Menu - Settings - Services - "Opencaching.xx". 

      - title: c:geo does not know the location of a cache!
        content: |
            If you are Basic Member of geocaching.com and try to navigate to a cache directly from a search result, you might see this error message.

            If you are no Premium member the geocaching server does not provide coordinates in searches but only an estimation of the distance to the caches and "directional images".
            c:geo uses and shows this distance estimation and the "directional images" in the search results.
            The caches are still sorted by distance, but be aware that the distance shown is the one based on your location when you performed that search. It will not change if your position changes.

            Additionally you will not be able to show a map of those results or directly navigate to a cache as c:geo does not have the coordinates for these caches.

            To get exact coordinates as a basic member you have to do one of the following:

            1. Open the details or save the geocache to your device. This will request the exact coordinates.

            2. Enable the CAPTCHA in the c:geo settings if desired (Menu - Settings - Services - geocaching.com - Basic member options). 
            After entering the CAPTCHA c:geo will have the coordinates and proper sorting by distance, showing on map and navigating is possible.

            If you are premium member and c:geo does not know the location of a cache, please check your login and relogin to make sure c:geo knows you are a premium member.

      - title: How can I use the Radar navigation? 
        content: |
            The "Radar" function works together with the third party app called "GPS Status & Toolbox" available on [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2).

            Once you installed the app c:geo will additionally offer "Radar" as a navigation option.

      - title: The dates in the logbook are wrong or not shown at all! 
        content: |
            If you are running the legacy version of c:geo (only for Android version below 2.3) we have some limtations regarding the supported date formats of geocaching.com.
            In all other versions of c:geo all possible date formats are supported.

            If you are on an Android version above 2.2 and notice incorrect dates please update to the newest version of c:geo and refresh the affected caches.

            The following explanation is only applicable to the legacy version of c:geo:

            With the legacy version the following formats are supported:

            yyyy-MM-dd \\
            yyyy/MM/dd \\
            MM/dd/yyyy \\
            dd/MMM/yyyy \\
            MMM/dd/yyyy \\
            dd MMM yy

            (dd = day, MM = month, yyyy/yy = year)

            The format can be changed on the geocaching websites user preferences page.

            Maybe you notice that one format is missing: dd/MM/yyyy \\
            The reason for this is quite simple: \\
            Is 04/10/2011 the 4th of October or 10th of April? So we would have to guess which would lead to inconsistency. 
            Since MM/dd/yyyy is the default at the geocaching website we are supporting this. 
            No problems have ever been reported with MM/dd/yyyy. If you have problems please change the date format to this on the website and refresh the caches showing wrong dates.

- title: Live Map
  items:
      - title: What are the different markers on the cache icons?
        content: |
            In order to provide more info about the status of a cache c:geo provides several markers which are shown together with the cache icon on the live map.

            Below you will find a short description of them:

            Pen icon: Personal note available for this cache \\
            Flagpost icon: Cache is shown at modified coordinates \\
            Disk icon: Cache is saved on device \\
            Yellow Smiley: You already found this cache \\
            Red Smiley: An offline log is stored in c:geo for this cache \\
            Yellow star: This is your own cache

      - title: Why do I see ??-caches on the map?
        content: |
            It is normal that you sometimes see some ??-caches on the map.

            The ?? means that c:geo was not able to identify the type of this cache.
            This mostly happens if too many caches are displayed at once (i.e. your zoom level is very low or the cache densitiy is very high).
            If you reduce the amount of caches shown (by zooming in) or if you click on a specific cache you will get the info about the cache type.


      - title: I cannot use Google Maps anymore!
        content: |
            On some devices there seems to be a problem for c:geo to initially detect whether Google Maps is installed on them.
            This leads to the problem, that only OSM maps are offered on the live map at the first start of c:geo after installing it.

            If this happens to you, please force stop c:geo or reboot your phone and start c:geo again.
            Then open the live map, click the layer icon and select Google Maps. After doing this once, usually Google Maps will stay available.
