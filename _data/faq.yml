      - title: I am new to Geocaching. How does all of this work?
        content: |
            Explaining all details of Geocaching would be a little to much here. However there are some facts you need to know to start Geocaching with c:geo:

            1. You need an account on a geocaching platform to use it in c:geo:

                We are supporting [geocaching.com](http://www.geocaching.com/), which is an international caching platform, and Opencaching platforms in several countries (e.g. [opencaching.de](http://www.opencaching.de/), [opencaching.pl](http://www.opencaching.pl/)).

                Choose the platform you would like to use, go to the website and create an account (basic accounts are usually free of charge).

                After you retrieved a username and password for one of the platforms, enter them in c:geo settings to allow c:geo to login to the server.

            2. You have to learn about the different cache types, D/T-ratings, etc.

                You might not be successful finding a cache by just selecting a random one in c:geo and navigating to it. There is a lot more which you need to know in order to pick a cache which is suitable for you.

                Most of the mentioned platforms offer detailed tutorials about how Geocaching works. We strongly suggest, that you read through these tutorials to learn what you need to know to find your first cache and how to log it.

                Especially you should be aware of the different types of caches (You will typically not find a mystery cache at the given coordinates) and the T-rating (a rating of 5 means, that you need to climb/swim/dive to get the cache).

            3. Find a cache near you and try it:

                Use the "Live Map" or the "Nearby" function of c:geo to see which caches are around you. Pick a cache (a traditional cache with a low D/T rating will be a good starting point) which you would like to find and go for it!

            Once again: You should make yourself familiar with the different types, terrain ratings, attributes, etc. before starting out to find a cache.

      - title: How to login?
        content: |
            When you start c:geo the first time it will directly take you to the service settings where you can enter your username and password for the desired caching platforms.
            To access the service menu manually from the c:geo main screen please select: \\
            Menu - Settings - Services

            After you entered your username and password there, all you have to do is pressing the back key on your device until you reach the c:geo main menu. On the next start c:geo will automatically take you there.

            When you are at the main menu, most functions should be self explanatory. Otherwise you might also find some hints in this FAQ.

      - title: I see caches in c:geo, but how to get them?
        content: |
            If you managed to see caches on the map or in the nearby list, select a cache and open its details.

            Read the listing text and pay attention to the D/T-ratings and attributes to learn more about how to log this cache.

            If you are good to go, press the "Navigate" icon (Pointing arrow) in the title bar.

            You will have several options depending on your needs. Here is a brief description of the most important navigation methods:

            - Compass:

                It will constantly show you distance and direction to the cache.

            - Radar (optional):

                If you installed an app supporting radar functions this will open a radar screen.
                It is similar to the compass, but the working mode is a little different. You will typically see the cache coordinates as a marker on the radar. If the marker reaches the center, you reached the cache coordinates.

            - Navigation (Drive, Walk, Cycle):

                This will start turn-by-turn navigation using Google Maps

            When you reach the coordinates, remember that GPS has an accuracy of several meters/feet only (also depending on your phones GPS performance). So you should look around your position as well to find the cache.

      - title: I forgot my username and/or password
        content: |
            c:geo is only using the login details you specified on the geocaching website.

            You have to go to the geocaching website to reset your password. After you successfully restored your password there, please go to c:geo settings and enter the new login data.
            
            For example on [geocaching.com](http://www.geocaching.com/) you can reset your password on [this page](https://www.geocaching.com/login/password.aspx).

      - title: How can I change to miles instead of meters?
        content: |
          c:geo uses metric units by default but should detect automatically if your phones default is set to imperial units.

          You can also manually select your preference in c:geo settings: \\
          Menu button - Settings - Appearance - "Use Imperial units"

      - title: Why do the cache details miss new information?
        content: |
          In order to minimize the network traffic c:geo downloads caches only once and stores them temporary or permanently (if you save them on your list).
          
          So if you miss some information (e.g. newest logs are missing, description has changed,etc.) please refresh the stored cache by selecting "Refresh" on the cache detail page.

      - title: Why are all cache coords wrong by some meters/feet?
        content: |
          In case you are not logged in the geocaching website does not provide correct coordinates. So it seems you did not provide login data or the login data you provided is not correct.
          
          Please refer to [Getting started](./faq.html#faq.IamnewtoGe) to learn how to login with c:geo.

      - title: Why does c:geo not use Groundspeak's public API?
        content: |
          The initial idea of c:geo is to provide a free (and open-source) app for mobile geocaching for everybody. \\
          What would change with the API? \\
          - c:geo only for premium members \\
          - No support for OpenCaching or other platforms than geocaching.com \\
          - Groundspeak advertisements 
          
          There are also problems with the development: \\
          - The API requires a private key for the app. But c:geo is open-source. There are a lot of independent developers, but only one would get the key. All other developers wouldn't be able to test what they do \\
          - c:geo would no longer be open source \\
          - Only a few core developers would be allowed \\
          - Much slower development would result from that\\

          While Groundspeak's API would fix most of our current problems, c:geo would then force users to pay money to a corporation. This is not the opensource spirit.
          If Groundspeak says OK to our ideas then c:geo might have an API some day...
