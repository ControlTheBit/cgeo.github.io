title: I am new to Geocaching. How does all of this work?
content: |
    Explaining all details of Geocaching would be a little to much here. However there are some facts you need to know to start Geocaching with c:geo:

    1. You need an account on a geocaching platform to use it in c:geo:

        We are supporting [geocaching.com](http://www.geocaching.com/), which is an international caching platform, and Opencaching platforms in several countries (e.g. [opencaching.de](http://www.opencaching.de/) and [opencaching.pl](http://www.opencaching.pl/)).

        Choose the platform you would like to use, go to the website and create an account (basic accounts are usually free of charge).

        After you retrieved a username and password for one of the platforms, enter them in c:geo settings to allow c:geo to login to the server.

    2. You have to learn about the different cache types, D/T-ratings, etc.

        You might not be successful finding a cache by just selecting a random one in c:geo and navigating to it. There is a lot more which you need to know in order to pick a cache which is suitable for you.

        Most of the mentioned platforms offer detailed tutorials about how Geocaching works. We strongly suggest, that you read through these tutorials to learn what you need to know to find your first cache and how to log it.

        Especially you should be aware of the different types of caches (You will typically not find a mystery cache at the given coordinates) and the T-rating (a rating of 5 means, that you need to climb/swim/dive to get the cache).

    3. Find a cache near you and try it:

        Use the "Live Map" or the "Nearby" function of c:geo to see which caches are around you. Pick a cache (a traditional cache with a low D/T rating will be a good startin point) which you would like to find and go for it!

    Once again: You should make yourself familiar with the different types, terrain ratings, attributes, etc. before starting out to find a cache.
