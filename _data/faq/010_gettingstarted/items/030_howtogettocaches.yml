title: I see caches in c:geo, but how to get them?
content: |
    If you managed to see caches on the map or in the nearby list, select a cache and open its details.

    Read the listing text and pay attention to the D/T-ratings and attributes to learn more about how to log this cache.

    If you are good to go, press the menu key and select "Navigate".

    You will have several options depending on your needs. Here is a brief description of the most important navigation methods:

    - Compass:
        It will constantly show you distance and direction to the cache.

    - Radar (optional):

        If you installed an app supporting radar functions this will open a radar screen.

        It is similar to the compass, but the working mode is a little different. You will typically see the cache coordinates as a marker on the radar. If the marker reaches the center, you reached the cache coordinates.

    - Navigation (Drive, Walk, Cycle):

        This will start turn-by-turn navigation using Google Maps

    When you reach the coordinates, remember that GPS has an accuracy of several meters/feet only (also depending on your phones GPS performance). So you might to look around your position as well to find the cache.
