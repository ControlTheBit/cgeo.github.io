title: I managed to login, but how to continue?
content: |
    If you start c:geo the first time, it will directly take you to the service settings.

    If you entered your username and password there, all you have to do is pressing the back key on your device until you reach the c:geo main menu. On the next start c:geo will automatically take you there.

    If you are at the main menu we hope most function are self explaining. Otherwise you might also find some hints in this FAQ.
