## You have an idea for improvements or new features?

### Before sending us a mail...

There are already a lot of ideas for possible new features and functionalities of c:geo. However we are only a small team of developers with limited ressources, who are maintaining c:geo in their free time and it is already a lot of work to maintain c:geo and solve bugs.

So it is impossible for us to implement those wishes by ourselves on short term.
But c:geo is open source, so anyone willing and able to help us is welcome to do so. 

We are also using our bugtracking system for documentation of new ideas and feature requests. Before contacting us with your idea please check check if it is not already contained in our list of [Feature Requests](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/issues?q=label%3A%22Feature+Request%22+sort%3Acreated-desc).

Our [FAQ](/faq.html) might also contain some answers about why certain features or functions are currently not implemented.
